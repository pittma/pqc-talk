## Post-Quantum Cryptography

PQC rides the line between hard and <span class="hl">trivially</span> hard.

* <span class="hl">Trivial Hardness</span> (LWE): a transform such that the encoded
  information cannot be recovered. That is, so much entropy is introduced that
  information is lost.

This technique is called <span class="hl">Learning With Errors</span>.
