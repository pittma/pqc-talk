## The Quantum Crack

A quantum computer can trivially find the <span class="hl">order</span> $r$
of a randomly chosen $1 < a < n$:

$$
a^r \equiv 1 \mod n
$$

We know that $n$ divides $a^r - 1$, so $n$ also divides (via the <span
class="hl">difference of squares</span>):

$$
(a^{r/2} - 1)(a^{r/2} + 1)
$$
