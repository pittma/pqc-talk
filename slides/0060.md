## Math and Technical Review

<ol class="bigger-ol">
  <li><span class="hl">Classical cryptography</span> is hard because
      prime-factoring large numbers is hard.
  </li>
  <li>In the presence of a <span class="hl">quantum computer</span>, we have an
      effective shortcut on that hard problem.
  </li>
  <li><span class="hl">Learning with errors</span> is a known hard problem
      without a quantum solution.
  </li>
  <li><span class="hl">Post-quantum cryptography</span> uses LWE in its schemes
      to protect against private key cracking.
