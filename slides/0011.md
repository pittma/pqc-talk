## What's Wrong with Classical Cryptography?

RSA's hardness is dependent on the difficulty in prime-factoring large numbers.
Keypairs are derived from large primes $p$ and $q$, which are on the order of
$2^{1024}$ (in the least, for RSA-2048).

Because:

$$
\varphi(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)
$$

To know $d$, we have to know $p$ and $q$, but only $n$ is made public.
