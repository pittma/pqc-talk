## What's Wrong with Classical Cryptography?

RSA's hardness is dependent on the difficulty in prime-factoring large numbers.
Keypairs are derived from large primes $p$ and $q$, which are on the order of
$2^{1024}$ (in the least, for RSA-2048).

### Key Generation

Generate $e$ and $d$, encryption and decryption keys respectively.

$$
n = pq \\
\text{Choose an } e \text{ s.t.} 1 < e < \varphi(n) \text{ and} \gcd(e, \varphi(n)) = 1 \\
d = e^{-1} \mod \varphi(n)
$$
